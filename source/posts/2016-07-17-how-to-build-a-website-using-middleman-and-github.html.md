Website is an essential part of our digital lifestyle. Freelancers need website to showcase themselves, businesses need website to market their products and you need a website to maintain your online presence.

There are multiple ways of creating a website with the advancement of technology nowadays but I will be showing you how to build a [static site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) particularly and the best part is, you get to host it for FREE!

## Why Static Site?

You might be wondering, why static site? One reason, because it's blazing fast!

A static site doesn't have any dynamic contents as it consists mainly of HTML and CSS files. No fancy database is needed like [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) which reduces the server response time, making your website load extremely fast.

It is also easy to cache using CDNs such as [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

Static site is a perfect choice for personal websites, blogs, and landing pages as these sites do not require any contents to be generated on the fly.

## Prerequisites

As this is a pretty technical blog post, you will need some experience in using terminal, code editor and code sharing site such as [Github](https://github.com)

Middleman is a static page generator built using [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) so you will need to install Ruby on your machine along with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) ([RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) Management Tool).

If you don't have Ruby installed yet, follow the tutorial [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) to get Ruby up and running on your machine.

Once that is done, install Bundler using the following command:

```bash
$ gem install bundler
```

You are all set up. Let's get started!
